# FSJS-Project-Ten

This is the last and final project of the www.teamtreehouse.com Full-Stack JavaScript techdegree program. In this project, we used the server-side REST API created in the last project to create a full-stack application using React.js to manage the client-side.

Note: To run this project on your computer, follow the instructions:
1) Click "Clone or Download" to download the files.
2) Run two seperate terminals. 
3) In the first terminal, change your directory to the api folder located in the repository. Run the commands "npm install" and "npm run seed" to set up the server-side properly. Run the command "npm start" afterwards. If you see the notification "Connected to the database successfully!", your server is up and running.
4) In the second terminal, change your directory to the client folder. Run the command "npm install" and "npm start" to start up the client-side. If correctly working, you will see a page with the URL "localhost:3000" pop-up in your default browser.
